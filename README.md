This is the description of the Group 1.4.

Our site has three different features.
The first is 'Two States'.
    The main goal is that the user inputs two countries and gets the Visa requirements between them.
The second is 'Visa Country Status'.
    The main goal is that the user inputs his passport country and gets a world map color-coded with the Visa requirements for all the countries in the world.
The third is 'Flight Data Comparison'
    The main goal is that the user inputs their departure, destination country and other filters in order to get different flights ordered by price and duration.

This three features are imported together in one main file 'cs.py'. In order to visualize the code on streamlit, you need to run this file.
